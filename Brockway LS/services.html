    <p>
      A copy editor has to produce clear, accurate, concise and legally-safe
      copy. But, before we start we need to know how much editing the manuscript
      needs. Each level will take different amounts of time which will be
      reflecting in the price.
    </p>
    <p>So, what, exactly, does each editing level involve? We offer two levels:
    <!--numbered list-->
    <ol>
        <li>Light</li>
        <li>Medium</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h1>Level 1 - Light (proofreading) </h1>
    <p>Light editing is proofreading, and not editing. This is usually done whenever any changes have been made to the manuscript and once more before publication, to give it the final polish.
    </p>
    <p>This editing process is also called <i>verification editing, and its main purpose is to make sure that the manuscript is ready for publishing.</i>
    </p>
    <p>Light editing considers correcting errors in matters such as:
    <!--not numbered list-->
    <ul>
        <li>Spelling</li>
        <li>Grammar</li>
        <li>Punctuation</li>
        <li>Capitalised words</li>
        <li>Tables</li>
        <li>Lists</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>We use the UK’s Guardian Style Guide and Collins dictionary, to ensure that words are spelt correctly and are formatted correctly. For example, should the word have a capital?
    </p>
    <p>We need ensure that:
        <ul>
            <li>The punctuation and grammar are good enough for the meaning to be easily understood.
            </li>
            <li>Headings and subheadings, captions, list numbers and numbered headings have been set up with the correct font style (eg, bold, italic).
            </li>
            <li>Numbers in lists are consecutive and bullet lists are indented correctly, and use the right bullet points, according to the style guide.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>Level 2 – Medium (copy editing) (SfEP defination: structural)</h1>
    <p>The main purpose of medium editing is to make sure the manuscript is written with <b>a single voice for a single audience for a single purpose</b>, as well as being correct, consistent and accurate.
    </p>
    <p>It's also known as line editing.</p>
    <p>Level 2 editing considers everything listed under level 1 editing, plus checking the following:
    <ul>
        <li>Times</li>
        <li>Dates</li>
        <li>Names</li>
        <li>Figures</li>
        <li>Calculations</li>
        <li>URLs</li>
        <li>Abbreviations</li>
        <li>Acronyms</li>
        <li>Use of gender pronouns</li>
        <li>Etc.</li>
    </ul>
    Writing style is also a consideration when carrying out a Level 2 edit:
    <ul>
        <li>It must be written for the reader.</li>
        <li>It must be written for the purpose.</li>
        <li>It must be clear, concise and logical.</li>
        <li>Word usage must be appropriate.</li>
    </ul>
    The consistency of the manuscript is also checked:
    <ul>
        <li>Headers</li>
        <li>Subheaders</li>
        <li>Titles</li>
        <li>Etc.</li>
    </ul>
