    <p>
      Have you written a novel that you’d like to publish?
      <b
        >Then working with an editor is the next logical step on your
        journey.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      We are professional fiction editors working with independent authors to
      help them create seamless, engaging stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s our role to hunt down and advise you on anything that may be dragging
      the attention of your readers away from your story.
      <b>Good editing makes sure your story is centre stage</b>, which is
      precisely where it should be – not held hostage to misused words, dodgy
      punctuation or confusing inconsistencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      You’re smart enough to recognise the need for those final refinements that
      will give your book the edge, instead of falling off it.
      <b>You’ve worked hard to craft a gripping tale</b>, and you want to ensure
      that when you show your book to the world it is the very best it can be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>We can bring fresh eyes to your story. </b>Expert, trained eyes that
      will spot things your weary writer gaze may gloss over out of sheer
      familiarity with your material. And we promise to be gentle with your
      words, and to respect your authorial voice because we understand how
      important these things are to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      We work with authors publishing in many genres, but have
      <b
        >a passion for cosy mysteries, paranormal romance and urban fantasies
        stories.
